Web development project

Tools: Html, CSS, Bootstrap

For this project I am creating a dashboard that will help the user compare data sets of a weather form different parts of the world.

Landing page: This is the first page the user will see and begin the visualization. The landing page contains a brief discription of the analysis given with a main data image and the continuing data images on the side of the page which can also be selected to get a full image view. The navigation bar options ("plots","comparison", and "data") will navigate you to the apporpriate page. The "plots" button will drop down for full image visuals for each data set.

Comparison page: This section will display a clear visual of all of the data images on one page for side-by-side comparison. Also contains the navigation bar and "Latitude" as the "home" button.

Data page: The Data section contains a table of the entire data that has been analyzed. This is very useful if the user wants to find the exact data from each city in the analysis. Also has the navigation bar with the "Latitude" home button.

Navel Biodiversity Dashboard In this assignment, I was given a dataset of belly button biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, and to create a interactive dashboard to explore that dataset.

Dropdown Menu The landing page will start with the first Subject ID information as well as data visuals. The dropdown menu contains the Subject ID's that the user can choose to see the plotted data on that subject.

Bar Chart This graph shows the top 10 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and the amount found of each OTU. The user can hover their cursor over the desired bar to display the OTU label.

Bubble Chart The bubble chart utilizes the same data as the bar chart but with more color and different perspective. Hovering the cursor over a bubble will also show the OTU label.
