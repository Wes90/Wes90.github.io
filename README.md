## Telecom-Data-Analysis


For this project, I decided to find a telecommunication dataset to analize, create a dashboard, and build models to predict the churn of clients. The data contains information about almost six thousand users, their demographic characteristics, the services they use, the duration of using the operator's services, the method of payment, and the amount of payment.

## PLOTLY DATA DASHBOARD

**Languages: Javascript, Html Tools: Plotly**

Navel Biodiversity Dashboard In this assignment, I was given a dataset of belly button biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, and to create a interactive dashboard to explore that dataset.

Dropdown Menu The landing page will start with the first Subject ID information as well as data visuals. The dropdown menu contains the Subject ID's that the user can choose to see the plotted data on that subject.

Bar Chart This graph shows the top 10 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and the amount found of each OTU. The user can hover their cursor over the desired bar to display the OTU label.

Bubble Chart The bubble chart utilizes the same data as the bar chart but with more color and different perspective. Hovering the cursor over a bubble will also show the OTU label.

## LEAFLET CHALLENGE

**language: Javasctipt, html library: Leaflet**

In this challenge I used data from the United States Geological Survey(USGS) to create a geo map using Leaflet. This contains the past 7 days of earthquake data and is updated every minute.

On the Map shows the location, depth, and magnitude of each recorded datapoint. The depth reflects the color and the magnitude reflects the size of each datapoint. There is also a pop up feature that displays the data information when the user clicks on the datapoint.
